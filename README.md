## Why self-host?

Personal agents are much more useful when they can sign in, book, buy and act
on your behalf. But your accounts, your passwords, are the keys to your digital
kingdom. OpenInstinct runs in your own Vercel account. Secrets are encrypted
before they touch your database and models never see them. Verify yourself by
reading the code!

## Deployment

The deploy button provisions [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com) for cloud browsers,
[Neon](https://neon.tech) for Postgres, and a private Vercel Blob store for
browser images, per-user memory, and installation secrets. It also creates and
attaches a [Linq](https://linq.app) connector for iMessage. Vercel AI Gateway
handles inference. Usage is billed to your Vercel account.

On first use, OpenInstinct creates independent Better Auth and vault-encryption
keys in the private Blob store. Vercel supplies the application URL, database,
Browserbase, Blob, and Linq configuration, so the deploy flow requires no
environment-variable values. For a non-Vercel host or an existing installation
that manages its own keys, set both secret overrides and the public application
URL explicitly:

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://your-host
SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

The application database schema and versioned migrations live in `db/`. The
Drizzle application store uses `DATABASE_URL` for runtime queries; its migration
commands require the direct `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` connection. Run
`pnpm db:migrate` before starting against a new or upgraded local database.
Vercel uses Turbo to run the uncached migration task before its application
build. See [`db/README.md`](db/README.md) for existing-database adoption,
environment loading, and constraint-validation sequencing. Better Auth retains
its separate migration path.

Treat the private Blob store as production key material: deleting it loses the
automatically generated encryption key, and rotating that key requires
re-encrypting existing vault values.

### Blob storage

The one-click deploy creates and connects a private Blob store automatically.
Vercel supplies `BLOB_STORE_ID` and a short-lived `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` to each
deployment, so there is no long-lived Blob credential to copy.

OpenInstinct uses this store for persistent per-user memory and browser images.
Production conversations require it because memory is recalled before each agent
turn. Local Eve development uses process-local memory instead.

For an existing Vercel project, link it first with
`eve link --project <your-vercel-project> --non-interactive`, then create and
connect the store with one command:

```bash
pnpm exec vercel blob create-store open-instinct-images --access private --yes --environment production --environment preview --environment development
```

Outside Vercel, set `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` from a private Blob store instead.
The memory provider uses that token explicitly, and browser image capture uses the
same store.

### Linq iMessage setup

The deploy button creates a managed line, writes `LINQ_CONNECTOR`, and
attaches the inbound webhook trigger automatically. For an existing Vercel
project, link the checkout, create a Linq line, and attach its connector for both
app tokens and inbound webhook triggers:

```bash
vercel link
vercel connect create linq --connection-method line --name open-instinct --json
vercel connect attach <returned-connector-uid> --project <your-vercel-project> --environment production --triggers --trigger-path /eve/v1/linq --yes
vercel env add LINQ_CONNECTOR production --value <returned-connector-uid> --yes
eve deploy --non-interactive --yes
```

The create command returns the connector UID. Repeat the attachment and
environment-variable steps for preview or development if those environments
should use Linq too. `LINQ_PHONE_NUMBER` is an optional E.164 override that adds
a click-to-message shortcut in the workspace; Linq delivery itself uses the
line assigned to the connector.

Before the first sign-in, open the connector's Vercel Connect settings and
follow the one-time **Phone Numbers** verification instruction. Additional users
verify themselves by messaging the connector's Linq number once. The
`--triggers --trigger-path /eve/v1/linq` options are also required: attaching a
connector without them permits outbound token access but does not forward
incoming messages to OpenInstinct.

## Google Workspace connection

OpenInstinct can use a user's Gmail, Calendar, and read-only Contacts through a
user-scoped Google OAuth grant. Vercel Connect stores and refreshes the tokens;
OpenInstinct stores only the stable user identity used to request them. Gmail
access deliberately uses `gmail.modify`, not the permanent-delete
`mail.google.com` scope.

1. In one Google Cloud project, configure the OAuth consent screen and enable
   the Gmail API, Google Calendar API, and People API.
2. Create OAuth web credentials. Add
   `https://connect.vercel.com/callback` as an authorized redirect URI, then
   download the client-secret JSON.
3. Vercel expects top-level `clientId` and `clientSecret` keys, not Google's
   nested `web.client_id` and `web.client_secret` download. Convert the download
   into a temporary file outside the repository, then create and attach the
   connector:

   ```bash
   vercel link
   google_credentials_file="$(mktemp)"
   jq '{clientId: .web.client_id, clientSecret: .web.client_secret}' /absolute/path/to/downloaded-client-secret.json > "$google_credentials_file"
   vercel connect create google --connection-method oauth --name open-instinct --data @"$google_credentials_file"
   rm -f "$google_credentials_file"
   vercel connect attach <returned-connector-uid> --project <your-vercel-project> --environment production --yes
   vercel env pull
   ```

   Never commit either credential file.

4. Set `GOOGLE_CONNECTOR_UID` to the returned UID and redeploy. The default is
   `google/open-instinct`.

Gotchas:

- Attach the connector separately to every Vercel environment that should use
  it. A production attachment does not make preview or local development work.
- The Gmail read/modify scope is restricted. A Google OAuth app in Testing mode
  only works for listed test users, and those grants expire after seven days.
  Broader distribution requires Google's OAuth verification and may require a
  security assessment.
- The scopes requested here must also be declared on the Google consent screen.
  After changing scopes or enabled APIs, disconnect and reconnect the account so
  Google issues a grant with the new access.
- The grant is keyed to the authenticated OpenInstinct user. iMessage reaches
  the same grant only when its verified phone number maps to that Better Auth
  account.
- Google Contacts search uses a provider-side lazy cache, so a contact created
  moments ago may not appear immediately.
- Sending email and creating confirmed calendar events always require approval.
  Calendar events with attendees send Google invitations.

## Local development

The **Deploy with Vercel** flow above is the simplest way to run OpenInstinct. It
provisions the required services and credentials automatically. Local
development is a manual path and requires:

- Node.js 24 and pnpm 11.24.0
- Docker Desktop or another running Docker Compose installation
- Browserbase credentials from a [Browserbase API key](https://www.browserbase.com/settings) or a linked
  Vercel Marketplace resource
- AI Gateway access from an API key or a linked Vercel project's OIDC token

First clone and install the application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Merit-Systems/OpenInstinct.git
cd OpenInstinct
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

For fully manual setup, copy the environment template and add your Browserbase
and AI Gateway keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local

# Set BROWSERBASE_API_KEY and AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY in .env.local.
# BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID is optional when the key belongs to one project.
```

If you already use a Vercel project, link it to pull AI Gateway access. If that
project does not have Browserbase yet, the Marketplace CLI provisions and
connects it to the project:

```bash
pnpm exec eve link --project <your-vercel-project> --non-interactive
pnpm exec vercel integration add browserbase
```

Then start OpenInstinct:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts PostgreSQL from `compose.yaml`, applies the committed database
migrations, and starts the application. Stopping the development process also
stops and removes the PostgreSQL container; its data remains in the
`postgres-data` volume for the next run. Run `pnpm dev:app` when intentionally
using an externally managed database instead. If `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` is missing,
`pnpm dev` stops before starting Docker and points back to the recommended
Vercel flow or the manual `.env.local` setup.

Local development otherwise uses the same vault, Browserbase browser, and AI Gateway
path as the Vercel deployment. Better Auth and vault encryption use stable
local-only defaults when their variables are unset. Vercel deployments
provision them automatically in private Blob; other production hosts require
explicit secrets.
